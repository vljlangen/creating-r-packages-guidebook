# Introduction

Welcome to "Creating R Packages: A Step-by-Step Guide". This book is designed to help beginners dive into the world of R package development. Whether you're a data scientist, a statistician, or a hobbyist R programmer, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills to create your own R packages.

In this book, you'll learn how to:

- Set up your development environment
- Create the basic structure of an R package
- Write and document functions
- Add and document data
- Test your package to ensure reliability
- Build and check your package
- Share your package with others through GitHub

Each chapter is designed to be practical and hands-on, with step-by-step instructions and examples. By the end of this book, you'll have a fully functioning R package that you can share with the world.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll be using RStudio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R, to perform various tasks.

Let's get started on your journey to becoming an R package developer!
