# Setting Up Git and GitHub

For distributing your package to your friends or colleagues and for backup purposes, it is always advisable to push your package to a code repository. In this tutorial, we will use the GitHub service.

If you have never used GitHub before or don't have a working connection between GitHub and your computer, you'll need to follow a tutorial to set up Git and GitHub. There are many excellent tutorials available online, and I recommend starting with one to get familiar with the process.

One such tutorial is available on Medium and provides a simple guide for setting up Git on MacOS:

[Setting Up Git on Mac](https://medium.com/@mateus2050/setting-up-git-on-mac-c14d70e278b8)

Similar tutorials are available for other platforms, such as Windows.

Disclaimer: I have not tried the above tutorial myself. While the above tutorial seems like a good one, it's always a good idea to explore multiple resources to find the approach that works best for you.
